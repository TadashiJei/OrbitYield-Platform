# OrbitYield: Cross-Chain Yield Aggregator Development Workflow

## Project Overview

OrbitYield is a cross-chain DeFi yield aggregator that automatically allocates funds to the highest-yielding opportunities across Polkadot and other blockchain networks. The platform leverages Polkadot's interoperability features to maximize returns while providing risk assessment, auto-rebalancing, and additional LP token rewards.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

#### Smart Contract Development
- Develop core yield aggregator contracts for Polkadot (ink!)
- Implement EVM-compatible contracts for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain
- Create LP token contracts and staking mechanisms
- Implement basic cross-chain messaging capabilities

#### Frontend Core
- Complete wallet connection interfaces (MetaMask, Polkadot.js)
- Develop user authentication flow
- Build portfolio tracking components with real data
- Implement chain selection interface

#### Backend Services
- Set up MongoDB database for user data
- Create API endpoints for yield opportunities
- Implement basic risk assessment algorithms
- Develop data indexing services for blockchain events

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 3-4)

#### Yield Farming Integration
- Connect to DeFi protocols on each target chain
- Implement deposit/withdrawal flows
- Create yield data aggregation services
- Build transaction monitoring system

#### Auto-Rebalancing System
- Develop rebalancing strategy contracts
- Implement threshold-based triggers
- Create optimization algorithms for cross-chain routing
- Build gas-efficient execution paths

#### Risk Management
- Enhance risk assessment models with ML components
- Implement risk scoring visualization
- Create risk-based allocation strategies
- Develop alerts for high-risk pools

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Optimization (Weeks 5-6)

#### Enhanced Cross-Chain Operations
- Implement XCM for seamless asset transfers
- Optimize cross-chain messaging for cost efficiency
- Add support for additional blockchains
- Develop fallback mechanisms for bridge failures

#### LP Token Ecosystem
- Implement governance features
- Create additional reward incentives
- Build LP token analytics dashboard
- Develop staking APY calculator

#### Performance Optimization
- Implement batched transactions
- Optimize gas usage across chains
- Create MEV protection mechanisms
- Develop performance monitoring dashboard

### Phase 4: Testing & Launch (Weeks 7-8)

#### Security & Auditing
- Perform internal security review
- Conduct external audit
- Implement security recommendations
- Set up monitoring and alert systems

#### User Testing
- Conduct comprehensive user testing
- Implement feedback and improvements
- Optimize UI/UX based on user insights
- Develop comprehensive documentation

#### Mainnet Deployment
- Deploy contracts to testnets
- Perform final testing
- Deploy to mainnet
- Monitor initial performance

## Workflow Protocols

### Git Workflow
1. **Branch Strategy**
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `develop`: Integration branch for features
   - `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
   - `fix/*`: Bug fix branches
   - `release/*`: Release candidate branches

2. **Commit Conventions**
   - feat: New feature
   - fix: Bug fix
   - docs: Documentation change
   - style: Formatting, code style
   - refactor: Code restructuring
   - perf: Performance improvement
   - test: Tests
   - chore: Build, tooling changes

3. **Pull Request Process**
   - Create PR from feature branch to develop
   - Require code review approval
   - Pass automated tests
   - Merge using squash and merge

### Development Environment
1. **Local Setup**
   - Next.js frontend
   - Local blockchain node for testing
   - MongoDB instance
   - Node.js backend services

2. **Testing Environment**
   - Test network deployments (Moonbeam, Goerli)
   - Staging API endpoints
   - Test database instances

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Lint checks
   - Build verification
   - Deployment to test environment
